                            <a>Educational Robots are making their way, in a good way!</a>
                            <p>As we move to the future, we get more innovative and more focus in technology. One of the future of technology holds are robots. Robots are what we say, are coming. Not to wreck havoc but to help us humans. There are a lot of kinds of robots but let’s focus on educational robots.

							  <p>So you wonder what are educational robots. Well, educational robots are robots that would help teachers in teaching the kids/students and to also help in regulating the classroom or to maximize the skills of students in robotics and in programming . We all know that kids loves something out of ordinary or something that would excite them, so these robots will help in achieving that. But there are debates whether if its a good idea to place robots on classrooms. According to a European survey from 2012, public attitudes to robots of over 27,000 people found that 34 % thought robots should be banned from the field of education (Eurobarometer 382 2012). 60 % thought that robots should be banned from the care of children, the elderly or the disabled. Only 3 % of those surveyed thought that robots should be used in education. So it is somewhat mix reaction but for me, it is a great idea to put educational robots to a classroom since there are advantages that can be achieve.</p>
							  <p><b>Advantages<p></b>
							  <blockquote><p>•	Objects of study for students to practice programming. Educational robots enable students of all ages to become familiar with and deepen their knowledge of robotics and programming, while at the same time learning other cognitive skills. At a young age, students can honed their skills and knowledge in programming and may be become one of the creators of robots in the future. It can also practice their analyzation and problem solving skills. Their creativity and imagination will fuel them in making their robots and it is also a motivation. There are kinds of educational robots that are popular in children and young people.</blockquote>

							  <p>Makeblock mBot: this is a robot with wheels designed to introduce children to robotics, programming and electronics. It is easy to assemble and easy to control thanks to Scratch-based software designed for children. Its compatibility with the Makeblock platform and its electronic parts based on the Arduino open-source ecosystem allow more experienced users to create more complex robots.</p>
							  <img src="./assets/Blog-post/image11.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"/>
							  <p>Robo Wunderkind: it consists in a set of blocks that the children can connect as they wish to build their own robot. Each block has a function identified with a colour (camera microphone, motion sensors...) and, after building their robot, the children can use an app to program it to react to certain noises, avoid obstacles or play music when someone approaches, among other functions.</p>
							  
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>•	It can be an aid to teachers</blockquote>
							  <p>By having a robot at the teacher’s side, they would share the responsibilties in handling the students so that teacher’s can take a rest without worrying.  These robots can serve as customized instructors for individuals or groups, engage with students to enhance social and emotional skills and keep detailed data on their interactions so teachers can track student development.</p>

							  <p>All in all, robots can help the teachers and students in achieving their goals and it can widen the learning objectives and techniques in the future.</p>

                            <a>Let’s collab with one another!</a>
                            <p>Collabs are great. Two or more than people collaborating  in order to come up with ideas and contents like in youtubers in Youtube or any other social media platforms. But let’s level up. What if we collab with robots? What would be the outcome of it? But first, what are Collaborative Robots?   
                            </p>

							<div class="panel">
							<p>Collaborative Robots , referred to as cobots or co-robots, are the newest type of robots designed to interact with people in a shared work environment. The idea of collaborative robots first came up from a 1995 research mission fronted by the General Motors Foundation. The mission aimed to come up with a way in which robots or robot-like equipment would safely team up with humans in their respective environments. This initiative produced the first collaborative robots that had no internal power source. This was a done to ensure human safety. The technicians who worked with the cobots were to provide the power and instructions. The cobot can be steered or redirecting a payload in cooperation with the human worker. Today, cobots have become a key part of production in many factories. Still, the majority of people scarcely know the difference between cobots and traditional industrial robots.</p>
							
							  <p><b>Advantages<p></b>
							  <blockquote><p>• Cobots have safe, smart behaviour.</blockquote>
							  <img src="./assets/Blog-post/image22.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"/>
							  <p>This class of robots is designed to work seamlessly alongside human workers. Unlike regular robots that could hurt a person in their vicinity, collaborative robots use advanced visual technology and are equipped with sophisticated sensors that enable them to detect people and stop or change their activity. Thanks to these advancements, cobots don’t need enclosures to ensure people around them are safe.</p>
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>• Cobots cooperate with humans</blockquote>		
							  <img src="./assets/Blog-post/image24.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>	
							  <p>The classic industry robot is autonomous and once set to carry out a certain activity by a trained programmer, it is left to perform the task following the fixed program. Cobots, on the other hand, work with people and behave smartly. They are left in the open just like any staff to work in partnership with other workers. They assist in completing complex tasks that cannot fully be automated. They come in handy in a process that is highly repetitive or droning tasks.</p>
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>• Collaborative robots are teachable</blockquote>	
							  <img src="./assets/Blog-post/image26.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"/>
							  <p>Cobots are highly flexible and do not require any expert knowledge to program. You only need a tablet to set the required program on these plug and play generation of robots.Some can also be programmed by simply moving the arm in the required pattern. Such cobot models actually learn the requirements independently without needing programming. A technician could simply perform a movement following a given pattern with the robot arm and it will imitate it. Other models can also take work instructions simply by using a graphic user interface.</p>				  
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>• You can use cobots virtually anywhere</blockquote>
							  <img src="./assets/Blog-post/image28.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"/>
							  <p>With their sophisticated sensors and advanced imaging technology, cobots can be used anywhere. They will detect objects or people on their way and stop when necessary. They are also light and easy to move around and use at points other than on the production floor. This is in complete contrast to classic industrial robots that would be typically heavy and designed to work autonomously in a fixed environment. Once these robots were installed, they would rarely be moved.</p>
							  <p><b>What can cobots do:</b></p>								  
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>Given their high levels of adaptability, typically smaller size, easy mobility, and lightweight, collaborative robots can perform a variety of tasks and lots of different types of automation services. Typically, these machines save factory workers from dangerous tasks — transporting of sharp, piercing items or hot industrial workpieces. Cobots also help reduce accidents and allow operators to focus on tasks that need human intervention and that are generally less arduous.</blockquote>
							  <p><b>Types of Collaborative Robots:</b></p>
							  
							  
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>1.	Safety Monitored Stop: collaborative robots defined as safety monitored stop are intended for applications that have minimal interaction between the robot and human workers. Typically, these types of collaborative robots actually leverage an industrial robot with a series of sensors that stop robot operation when a human enters the work envelope</blockquote>
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>2.	Speed and Separation: these types of collaborative robots are similar to safety monitored stop collaborative robots in the fact that they leverage an industrial robot. However, speed and separation collaborative robots use more advanced vision systems to slow operations down when a human worker approaches and stop operation altogether when a worker is too close to the robot.</blockquote>
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>3.	Power and Force Limiting: these types of collaborative robots are built with rounded corners and a series of intelligent collision sensors to quickly detect contact with a human worker and stop operation. These collaborative robots, which use collaborative robot arms, also feature force limitations to ensure any collisions are unlikely to result in injury. </blockquote>
							  <p></b><blockquote><p>4.	Hand Guiding:  these collaborative robots are equipped with a hand-guided device by which an operator directly controls the motion of the robot during automatic mode. While in automatic mode, the robot performing hand-guiding collaboration responds only to the operator's direct control input. This allows the robot, for example, to support the weight of a heavy workpiece while the operator manipulates it into position, thereby reducing the operator's risk of repetitive-stress injury. Similar capabilities can be used to "teach" or program a robot, but properly speaking, hand guiding as a collaborative operation occurs while the robot is in automatic mode, during normal production, whereas programming is not done in automatic mode nor used during production.</blockquote>
							  
							  <p>Overall, cobots can perform many roles across various industries. They can work alongside humans in virtually any work environment. From industrial production floors, PLC automation to offices, these collaborative machines can handle tasks such as packing of commodities, assembly, machine tending, PLC automation to offices, these collaborative machines can handle tasks such as packing of commodities, assembly, machine tending, palletising, just to mention a few.</p>
